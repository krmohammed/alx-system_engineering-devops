# Learning Bash Scripting Project

## Overview

This project is designed to provide a hands-on learning experience for mastering Bash scripting fundamentals. The primary objectives of this project include creating SSH keys, understanding the importance of script shebangs (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`), and gaining proficiency in using loop and conditional constructs (`while`, `until`, `for`, `if`, `else`, `elif`, `case`). Additionally, this project covers the usage of the `cut` command and explores file and other comparison operators.

## Objectives

Upon completion of this learning project, I should be able to:

1. **Create SSH Keys:**
   - Generate SSH keys using the `ssh-keygen` command.
   - Understand the purpose and importance of SSH keys in secure communication.

2. **Understand Shebangs:**
   - Differentiate between `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and `#!/bin/bash`.
   - Recognize the advantages of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` for script portability.

3. **Loop and Conditional Constructs:**
   - Utilize `while`, `until`, and `for` loops for iterative tasks.
   - Implement `if`, `else`, `elif`, and `case` condition statements for decision-making in scripts.

4. **Master the `cut` Command:**
   - Extract specific characters (`-c` option) or fields (`-f` option) from text.
   - Understand and use the `-d` option to specify delimiters.
   - Explore the `--complement` option for complementing the selection.

5. **File and Other Comparison Operators:**
   - Utilize file operators (`-e`, `-f`, `-d`) for file-related checks.
   - Employ other comparison operators (`-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt`, `-le`, `-gt`, `-ge`) for numerical comparisons.
